### Production Environment
- `RAILS_HOST` environment variable for custom domains
- Host authorization configured for Railway domains
- Health check endpoint excluded from host checks
- SSL/HTTPS enforced

### Railway Configuration
- Health check endpoint: `/up`
- Automatic migrations on deploy
- Health check timeout: 100 seconds
- Restart policy: ON_FAILURE with max 10 retries

## Required Environment Variables

All these must be set in Railway dashboard or via CLI:

### Rails Configuration
- `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` - Master key for credentials
- `SECRET_KEY_BASE` - Rails secret key
- `RAILS_ENV=production`
- `RAILS_HOST` - Your custom domain (optional)

### Database
- `DATABASE_URL` - Auto-set by Railway PostgreSQL plugin

### Stripe (Test Mode)
- `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Stripe publishable key
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Stripe secret key
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Stripe webhook secret

### AWS S3

- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - AWS secret key
- `AWS_REGION` - S3 region (e.g., us-east-1)
- `AWS_BUCKET` - S3 bucket name

## Next Steps

1. **Install Railway CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login and Initialize**
   ```bash
   railway login
   railway init
   ```

3. **Add PostgreSQL**
   ```bash
   railway add --plugin postgresql
   ```

4. **Set Environment Variables**
   Use the CLI or dashboard to set all required variables

5. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

6. **Run Migrations**
   ```bash
   railway run rails db:migrate
   ```

## Verification Checklist

Before deploying, ensure:
- [ ] All environment variables are documented
- [ ] AWS S3 bucket exists and is configured
- [ ] Stripe test keys are ready
- [ ] Database migrations are tested locally
- [ ] Health check endpoint responds at `/up`
- [ ] SSL/HTTPS is configured (Railway does this automatically)

## Testing in Production

After deployment:
- [ ] Verify application loads at Railway URL
- [ ] Test database connection
- [ ] Test file uploads to S3
- [ ] Test Stripe payment flow with test card
- [ ] Verify webhooks are receiving events
- [ ] Check logs for errors

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:
1. Check logs: `railway logs`
2. Verify environment variables
3. Rollback via Railway dashboard
4. Or deploy previous commit: `git checkout <previous-commit> && railway up`
