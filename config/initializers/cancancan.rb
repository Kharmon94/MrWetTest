# CanCanCan configuration
# This file configures the CanCanCan authorization library

# By default, CanCanCan will look for an Ability class in the app/models directory
# We've defined our Ability class in app/models/ability.rb

# You can customize CanCanCan behavior here if needed
# For example, you can change the default authorization action:
# CanCan::ControllerAdditions.skip_authorize_resource = true

# Or customize the unauthorized access handling:
# CanCan::ControllerAdditions.unauthorized_message = "You are not authorized to perform this action."

# The main configuration is done in the Ability class itself
